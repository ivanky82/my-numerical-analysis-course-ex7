# my-numerical-analysis-course-ex7
Created matlab/octave codes to be used in Lab 7 of my numerical analysis course. However, this is still in Indonesian language.  This exercise is about numerical methods to find derivative of functions of one variable.
The file ex7.m is the main file of this exercise. It contains information on how to do this exercise.
